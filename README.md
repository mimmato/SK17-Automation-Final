## Project Overview

This project is an automated testing framework built using **TestNG**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern. It automates key user interactions within a web application, including **user registration**, **login**, and **home page** functionalities. The framework is designed to be modular, reusable, and scalable, ensuring efficient test maintenance and easy extensibility.

## Project requirements

- Develop a **Java Maven** test automation project using **TestNG** and **Selenium WebDriver**.
- Follow the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern with **PageFactory** for project structure.
- Automate at least **5 different test scenarios** against the following website:

  **[Skillo Training Website](http://training.skillo-bg.com:4300/posts/all)**

- Include a **testng.xml** file for test execution.
- Ensure that all tests can be executed using **testng.xml** in the **Chrome browser**.
- Capture a **screenshot** on test failure and save it to a designated directory.
- Host the project in a **public GitHub repository**.
- Provide a **README.md** file that explains the project and describes the implemented test cases.


## How to Clone the Project Using IntelliJ

If you're using IntelliJ, follow these steps to clone the project:

1. Go to **File** > **New** > **Project From Version Control**.
2. Copy the following URL to your clipboard:
```   
https://github.com/mimmato/SK17-Automation-Final.git
```
3. Paste the URL into the **URL** field.
4. Specify the directory where you want to save your project.
5. Click **Clone**.

The project will now be cloned to your specified directory, and you can begin testing.
The project is configured to execute a total of 9 tests within 3 class files in parallel and run in Chrome.

## How to Run tests

To execute the test suite, you can either right-click on the testng.xml file located in the project root directory and click **Run** or
use the **"Run / Debug Configuration"** option of IntelliJ (make sure the correct path to testng.xml is selected).

Alternatively, you may also enter the following command in your terminal to install dependencies:

```shell
mvn clean install
```
start the test:

```shell
mvn clean test
```

# Test Case Scenarios

## Home Page
- ‚úÖ Verify posts load correctly via scrolling.
- ‚ùå Click on a post and check interaction with elements.

## Registration Page
- ‚ùå Test registration with an **invalid username** that exceeds the length limit.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test registration with a **valid username** that triggers the **min length** (**bug**).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test registration with an **email that exceeds the length limit** (**bug**).
- ‚úÖ Test successful registration.

## Login Page
- ‚úÖ Test **successful login with a username**, exit, and verify "Remember Me" functionality.
- ‚úÖ Test **successful login with an email**, exit, and verify "Remember Me" functionality.
- ‚ùå Test login with an **incorrect username**.

### Legend
‚úÖ - positive path scenarios (Expected success or valid input)

‚ùå - negative path scenarios (Expected failure or invalid input)

‚ö†Ô∏è - bugs

### Expected Test Outcomes
- **Total tests:** 9
- **Expected to pass:** 7 ‚úÖ
- **Expected to fail:** 2 ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Project contents

- **src/test/java**:
    - **BaseTestConfig**: Centralized setup and teardown for WebDriver initialization, screenshot capture on test failures, and environment cleanup.
    - **HomePageTests**: Executes 2 test scenarios (verifyLoadingOfPostsOnHome() and interactWithPostOnHome())
    - **RegistrationPageTests**: Executes 4 test scenarios (testInvalidUsernameTooLong(), testValidUsernameTooShortBug(), testRegWithSuccessMessagesEmailBug(), testRegSuccess())
    - **LoginPageTests**: Executes 3 test scenarios (testLoginUserSuccessExitRemember(), testLoginEmailSuccessExitRemember(), testLoginWrongUser(), insertWrongUserAndPass())

- **src/main/java**:
    - **BasePageObject**: Holds methods used for navigation through the app and serves as extension for the other objects (inheritance).
  
    - **HomePageObject**: Holds methods for interactions on the Home Page.
  
    - **RegistrationPageObject**: Holds methods for validations of text fields, generation of user registrations etc.
  
    - **LoginPageObject**: Holds methods for interactions with web elements on the Login Page.


- **src/test/resources/screenshots**: directory set up in the **BaseTestConfig** file. Its contents are deleted @BeforeSuite, so users can inspect evidence following the TestSuite execution run. Contents are also\
excluded in the .gitignore file.

- **testng.xml**: Specifies the configuration for running the tests in parallel. It defines the test suite, test parameters, and the classes to be executed. 
In this case, it executes 3 Test Classes in parallel.


- **pom.xml**: Specifies the Maven configuration for your project, including project metadata, dependencies, and build settings.
